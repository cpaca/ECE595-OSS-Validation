# Pandas DataFrame Fuzzing Test

This Python script generates random operations on a pandas DataFrame to test various functionalities and error handling through fuzzing tests.

## Description

The script performs the following tasks:

- Generates a larger pandas DataFrame with random data.
- Uses a fuzzer to generate random input strings.
- Applies random operations on the DataFrame based on the input strings.
- Prints the DataFrame after each operation.

## Method

To implement fuzzing within the DataFrame class, the following steps were taken:

1. **Data Generation:**
    - **generate_random_str(length: int) -> str:** This function generates a random string of specified length using ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.
    - **generate_larger_dataframe(num_rows: int) -> pd.DataFrame:** This function generates a DataFrame with the specified number of rows containing random data for the 'Name', 'Age', and 'City' columns.

2. **Fuzzing:**
    - **fuzzer() -> str:** This generator function yields random strings to serve as input for testing DataFrame operations.

3. **Operation Application:**
    - **sample_function(input_str: str, df: pd.DataFrame) -> None:** This function applies operations to the DataFrame based on the input string generated by the fuzzer. It simulates a range of DataFrame operations, including adding rows, dropping columns, modifying data, sorting, resetting the index, deleting rows, and filling NaN values, while incorporating error handling to catch exceptions.

4. **Exporting Results:**
    - **export_results_to_file(results: list, file_path: str) -> None:** This function exports the DataFrame copy after each operation to a text file named 'results.txt'.

5. **Execution:**
    - **main():** The main function iterates through the DataFrame using the fuzzer and applies operations sequentially to generate results. Progress is printed every 100 iterations, and after 500 iterations, the results are exported to the 'results.txt' file.

By iterating through a series of fuzzed inputs and observing the DataFrame's behavior after each operation, potential vulnerabilities or issues in DataFrame manipulation functions can be identified, ensuring their reliability and stability in real-world data scenarios.
